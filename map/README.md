Animoog Users Map - Instructions for Contributing
============================================

This map is for the <a href="http://animoog.org/map">Animoog Users Map - animoog.org/map</a>, everyone is welcomed to contribute to it.


Use cases
---------

* Find Animoog users and fans near you and meet to share tips and tricks, and maybe even jam together?
* Find Moog-related stores around you
* Maps are fun!


Adding yourself to the map
--------------------------

THIS IS CURRENTLY THE BLOCKER - we need a way for John Doe to easily add himself on the map without being too laborious for non-geeks

BACKGROUND
Map data, such as the location of Animoog users and fans around the world, can be stored in a GeoJSON file. This file format is automatically displayed over a map by GitHub [1]. While there's more and more ways to leverage geojson data on GitHub [2], it remains pretty difficult for most people to add data on a GitHub GeoJSON file and associated map.
