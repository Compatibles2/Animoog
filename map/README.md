Animmoog Users Map - Instructions for Contributing
============================================

This map is for http://animoog.org/map , everyone is welcomed to contribute to it.


Use cases
---------

* Find Animoog users and fans near you and meet to share tips and tricks, and maybe even jam together?
* Find Moog-related stores around you
* Maps are fun!


Adding yourself to the map
--------------------------

(these need to be more detailed step-by-step instructions... coming...)
# Login or register to GitHub
# Go to https://github.com/alexandreleroux/Animoog/blob/master/map/animoog-map.geojson
# Click edit map (??)
# Pull request (??)


Warning
-------

PRIVACY warning: 
* Please add only yourself and Moog-related stores 
* Don't use the precise location of your home, you are responsible for the location accuracy and your associated privacy

To do
-----

* Use different pushpins per type (ie a different pushpin for stores than for people, etc.)
* After a certain number of entries/markers on the map (about 2,000?), feeding the map content directly from geojson won't probably work anymore, the solution might be to serve the geojson in WMS via geoserver.org (which, based on my initial search, can be installed on my current host) or mapserver.org or mapnik
