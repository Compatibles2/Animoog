Animmoog map - Instructions for contributing
============================================

This map is for http://animoog.org/map , everyone is welcomed to contribute to it.


Adding yourself to the map
--------------------------

(these need to be more detailed step-by-step)
* If you don't have a GitHub account:
** Goto geojson.io website, add a pushpin and send the resulting geojson code to me or just send me your location by email
* If you have a GitHub sccount: 
** Please add the markers you want to directly on the file by clicking on the geojson.io button once on the map

PRIVACY warning: 
* Please add only yourself and Moog-related stores 
* Don't use the precise location of your home

To do
-----

* Use different pushpins per type (ie a different pushpin for stores than for people, etc.)
* After a certain number of entries/markers on the map (about 2,000?), feeding the map content directly from geojson won't probably work anymore, the solution might be to serve the geojson in WMS via geoserver.org (which, based on my initial search, can be installed on my current host) or mapserver.org
