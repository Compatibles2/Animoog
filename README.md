Animoog Love
============

Data and code pertaining to the shared crowdsourced content of the <a href="http://animoog.org">Animoog.org website</a>. The actual content is available and described on the website itself. 

There's currently two components you'll find in this repos:
* The raw content of <a href="http://animoog.org/database/expansion-packs/">Expansion Packs table</a>, which lists Animoog Expansion Packs, especially those difficult to find because not available from within the app
* The <a href="http://animoog.org/playing/map/">Animoog Users Map</a> geojson file, which is currently missing simple instructions to contribute to

See the READMEs in the sub-folders for details about each of those components.

I'm open and willing to add much more, just drop me a note

Everything you'll find both on the website and in this Git repos is openly licensed
